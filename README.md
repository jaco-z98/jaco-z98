##âœ¨About me:âœ¨

I am a student of the last semester at the WrocÅ‚aw University of Technology, majoring in the engineering of mechatronic microsystems. During the course of my studies, I had the opportunity to learn several programming languages m.in: C/C++, Java, Python and the Django framework. I program and expand my knowledge in Python, because I am interested in the position of back-end developer. Programming has become my passion. I develop my knowledge in this direction thanks to independent learning and with the help of courses and books. I have the ability to think analytically and put personal development first. I am interested in taking up an internship or internship for the period of holidays.
